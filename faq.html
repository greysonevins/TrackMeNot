<a name="install"></a>
<h2>How do I install TrackMeNot?</h2>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" targer=_blank
class=regLink>Install or upgrade Firefox</a> if necessary - TMN runs in
version 1.5 or
greater.
<li>Click the 'Install TrackMeNot' link
<li>Click 'Install' in the dialog, (you may need to instruct Firefox to
accept downloads from mrl.nyu.edu; then Restart Firefox.
<li>You should now see the TMN icon in the status bar (bottom right-hand
corner of the browser window). It will indicate "Off".
<li>To start TMN, click 'TrackMeNot' in the Firefox 'Tools' menu. This will
change TMN's status to "On". After a few seconds you will see queries
start to appear in the status bar. <br>[Note: TMN requests are sent to search
engines just like 'real' requests, and so will end up in any history
kept by the site, e.g., Google's 'search-history' function]<Br>
<li>To disable display of queries in the status bar, view the query log, or to
adjust other options, select 'TrackMeNot->Options' in the Firefox 'Tools'
menu.
<li>To turn TMN off, locate 'TrackMeNot->Enabled' in the Firefox 'Tools' menu
& uncheck it.</ul>

<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h2>How do I upgrade to the current version of TrackMeNot?</h2>
<ul>
<li> Firefox's extension manager will alert you when TrackMeNot is updated,
and prompt you to install the upgrade.
<li>If you've disabled this function or want to do a manual upgrade,
simply follow the install instructions above.</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="remove"></a>
<h2>How do I remove TrackMeNot?</h2>
<ul><li>To remove TrackMeNot from your system, click
 'Tools->Extensions' in the Firefox menu and launch the
extension manager.
<li>Select TrackMeNot from the list of installed extensions,
then click the 'Uninstall' button.
<li>Restart Firefox to complete the uninstall.</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="freq"></a>
<h2>Can I control the rate at which TMN sends queries? </h2>
Yes. Go to 'Tools->TrackMeNot->Options' and select an average frequency.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="engines"></a>
<h2>Can I choose the search engines that TMN queries?</h2>
Yes. Go to 'Tools->TrackMeNot->Search-Engines' and select one or more
search-engines to query.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="terms"></a>
<h2>Can I control the search terms that TMN uses?</h2>

Yes, but not directly. TMN currently uses RSS feeds to generate its initial
set of queries. This listed can be edited, in the options panel
('Tools->Options->RSS Feeds'), by typing or pasting in the new
(comma-delimited) list, then pushing the validate button.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="filter"></a>
<h2>Isn't it easy for search companies (or third parties) to filter out TMN
queries?</h2>
The answer here is not straightforward; even with dynamically
evolving query sets and burst-mode timing, there are data-mining and machine-learning techniques which may well be able to filter some TMN queries based on data
patterns obtained from actual users. However, with the combination of
randomized scheduling and query lengths, inclusion of changing terms from RSS
feeds, and evolving query sets, we believe the difficulty for 3rd parties wishing to aggregate such data into accurate or identifying profiles is significantly
increased.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>
Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="identity"></a>
<h2>Can TMN effectively hide my identity?</h2>
To the extent that a third-party tries to identify you through searches
alone, TMN can potentially make this a lot more difficult. Much depends on the
search query terms included in future versions of TMN. If third-parties are using other means to identify you, e.g. through IP addresses and information from your ISP, TMN will be of little use.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="mining"></a>
<h2>Can TMN prevent mining and profiling of my searches?</h2>
This is a potentially promising application of TMN, particularly with version
0.4.x's use of dynamically evolving query terms.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="history"></a>
<h2>Isn't it a good thing that search companies keep track of my search
history?</h2>
In a perfect world, where search companies and other third parties could be
trusted, such histories would serve all of us well and promise greater
functionality to both the companies and individual searchers. As long as
search companies and other information collectors unilaterally develop and
pursue policies that don't take seriously the interests of individuals,
society, and standing political and social values, individuals will have to
make a choice between convenience and privacy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="control"></a>
<h2>Why is TMN so concerned with keeping control in the hands of individual users; as opposed to other strategies which use 3rd party servers/proxies?</h2>
The larger intention of TMN is to challenge the current practice of search
companies, and other third-parties, of unilaterally setting  policies on the
collection and use of personal information.
We think users should have a say; we think search
companies should listen. To level the playing field, we have sought to create
a mechanism that places some degree of control back in the hands of users and,
at every point in the design where this has been feasible, we have sought to
do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="terrorists"></a>
<h2>Won't software like this make it harder for the government
to catch real criminals (or terrorists) who might be using
the web for nefarious purposes?</h2>

We are unaware of any instances in which the analysis of search queries has helped law enforcement or security agencies deter or prosecute criminals or
terrorists.  Constitutional principles, however, place limits on what the government can and cannot do in such investigations. A targeted search on a particular
individual's online activities (once probable cause has been demonstrated) is
unlikely to be affected. TMN may, however, make unconstitutional 'fishing expeditions' more difficult, which is consistent with the values of a free society.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="clog"></a>
<h2>Will widespread deployment of TMN eventually 'clog' the search
engines it queries? </h2>
TMN no doubt places some  additional load on search engines (though TMN requests are tiny compared with other types of web-traffic --  e.g. images, animations,
music, video, etc.).  How much and how serious the impact will depend on the
number of users and their use patterns.  Our intention (and expectation) with
TMN is that its effect on search engines be minimal.  Further, universal
deployment of TMN is not a  goal of the project. Rather, we hope to offer a
level of  protection to individuals who may feel threatened by the practices
of search engines, and perhaps even to afford such users a small voice in the emerging debate on such practices.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="click"></a>
<h2> Does TMN ever simulate click-throughs on links that come up from "fake"
searches? </h2>

TMN now selectively "clicks-through" on links available in simulated searches.  The click-through algorithm is designed to minimize the possibility of
clicking on revenue-generating ads to avoid impacting ad-based business practices.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="guarantee"></a>
<h2> What kind of guarantees can TMN make regarding its effectiveness at
protecting my privacy? </h2>

We can make no guarantees without further evaluation measures, however, we believe that search companies may need to go to considerable trouble to separate user-generated from TMN-generated searches. Further, any such filtering efforts are likely to contain some number of 'false-positives'.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>
<a name="feedback"></a>
<h2> If one of the search engines were to come up with a new technical mechanism that
could defeat TMN, how would you even know? </h2>

There have been changes to which we have been able to respond, but there may
be current or future mechanisms of which we are unaware and hence not
able to respond to.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="random"></a>
<h2> How random is TMN's random timing mechanism. Isn't it likely that a search
engine (using the massive amount of user data they've already collected) could
distinguish 'any' random mechanism from real user search behavior? </h2>

With sufficient time and resources, search companies could likely detect a
majority of TMN searches with some certainty. We are continuously improving
TMNs timing mechanism to mimic, more closely, real usage patterns. New
releases of TMN (> v05) contain a 'burst' mechanism which schedules TMN
queries primarily when users are actually searching, thus avoiding 'patterns' in
TMN's randomness.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="ddos"></a>
<h2> How is this different than a (Distributed) Denial of Service attack or
spamware? </h2>

In providing a way for individual users to assert their privacy rights in
web-search, we believe TMN is a legitimate use of network and computing
resources. Although we understand that critics may use such rhetoric to cast
doubt on our efforts and intentions, we are confident that by all common
understandings, TMN is neither DOSware nor spamware. Here are definitions from
Wikipedia.

<p>
"a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer
resource unavailable to its intended users. Typically the targets are
high-profile web servers, and the attack attempts to make the hosted web pages
unavailable on the Internet." (Wikipedia, March 29 2007)

<p>
"Spamming is the abuse of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited
bulk messages, which are generally undesired." (Wikipedia, March 29 2007)

<p>
"Spamdexing is any of various methods to manipulate the relevancy or
prominence of resources indexed by a search engine, usually in a manner
inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system." (Wikipedia, March 29
2007)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="clickfraud"></a>
<h2> Does the selective click-through feature contribute to advertising "click-fraud"? </h2>

The selective click-through system is designed to minimize the probability of clicking on revenue-generating ads.  Search engines currently format ad-related links in a relatively consistent manner and TMN's current ad-avoiding techniques appear to be adequate for the time being.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="response"></a>
<h2> How have the search engine companies responded to this project? </h2>

They haven't.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="schneier"></a>
<h2> I read Bruce Schneier's review that said TrackMeNot doesn't work; is he
right? </h2>

No. First, his comments targetted the initial alpha release of TMN which is
significantly different from the current version. Second, he misconstrues the
goals of TMN.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="browsers"></a>
<h2> I would love to use TrackMeNot; why doesn't it work with browsers other
than Firefox? </h2>

Our resources are limited but we would be happy to collaborate with others who
would like to develop TMN for other browsers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="lang"></a>
<h2> I would love to use TrackMeNot in my language; is it supported?
 </h2>

We have been working extensively to make TMN easily translatable into more
languages. There are currently versions in Danish, German, French, Croatian, Dutch, Portuguese and Chinese.
We would be happy to collaborate with anyone wishing to extend
TMN to their language!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="tor"></a>
<h2> There are several projects that claim to protect privacy in web search
(e.g., Tor, Anonymizer, etc.) Which is most effective? Should I use TMN
instead of these others? </h2>

The use of TMN does not preclude the use of any of these other technologies
and the highest degree of protection will likely be obtained with some
combination of approaches; i.e., Tor, TMN and manual cookie-management.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="captcha"></a>

<h2>
Google sends me to a 'sorry' page and tells me that it suspects my machine of
being infected with spyware or a virus, and even prompts me for a captcha when
I try to search. Did the search engine detect TrackMeNot?</h2>

This is not a response to TMN in particular. However, some search engines
have begun to block (and/or request CAPTCHAs) from IP addresses that issue a
high number of queries. If you experience this behavior, we recommend that you
configure TrackMeNot with a lower query rate (10 queries per hour appears
to work well) and enable 'burst-mode.' This not only alleviates the strain on
search engines that TMN might be causing, and allows you to avoid the
CAPTCHAs, but also better mimics real human activity.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Can you explain each of TMN's features?</h2>
<a name="features"></a>
<ul>

<li><h3>RSS Support for seed-list generation/substitution (since 0.6.x)</h3>
	TMN now parses RSS feeds to generate some portion of its initial query
terms.  Following generation of the initial seed-list of query terms, TMN will
occasionally query a randomly selected RSS feed to get new terms.  A default
set of RSS feeds is provided with TMN, and users may edit and add new feeds in the TMN options panel.

<li><h3>Selective Click-Through(since 0.6.x)</h3>
	TMN now 'clicks-through' on some percentage of its searches by selecting and
navigating to links received in the search result to further simulate user
behavior.  The click-through mechanism is designed to minimize the probability of clicking on revenue-generating ads.

<li><h3>Realtime Search-Tracking</h3>
   TMN now recognizes when a 'real' search is being performed by a user
and can act on this information in a variety of ways (see below).

<li><h3>Dynamic URLs/Header Matching</h3>
   TMN now keeps track of where (for each search engine) you've last
searched and uses that URL to send its queries (for example, if you start
using the Google toolbar rather than Google's webpage, TMN will update itself to do the same). Similarly, TMN now stores the header information your browser is
sending out (browser type, version, OS, etc.) and mimics these in its own
queries.

<li><h3>Dynamic Queries </h3>
As of version 0.4.x, TMN's static word list has been replaced with a dynamic
query mechanism which 'evolves' each client (uniquely) over time, parsing the
results of its searches for 'logical' future query terms with which to replace
those already used.<p> Note: since the query list is continually evolving
according to TMN algorithms, changes made by hand-editing this file will be
overwritten. We hope to support user-supplied query lists in future versions.
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" class=regLink>Back to main page</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

<h2>Can you explain the various options that TMN supports?</h2>
<a name="options"></a>
<ul>

<li><h3>Burst-Mode</h3>
   Rather than sending queries only at randomized intervals, TMN (in burst-mode) recognizes when the user performs a search, then sends a 'burst' of queries
over the next few moments to simulate actual user behavior.  As of version 0.6.x, burst-mode further mimics user behavior by selecting longer queries and permuting them to form a number of smaller "thematic" queries.

<li><h3>Current Queries </h3>
This button allows the user to view the current state of TMN's evolving
query-list (see above for <a href="#features">description</a>).

<li><h3>RSS-feeds</h3>
TMN parses RSS feeds in two cases: a) to generate some portion of its initial
query set and, b) to occasionally make substitutions in this list with new RSS
data. While a default set of RSS feeds is provided (for each supported
language), TMN users can edit and/or add new feeds in the options panel. To do
so, change the text in the RSS text field (in the options panel), then click
the 'Validate' button. To revert back to the default set of feeds, click the
'Use Defaults' button in the options panel.

<li><h3>Logging Options </h3>
TMN offers 3 modes for logging: 1) 'disabled' - no logs are written, 2)
  'normal' (no options checked) - logs are kept for each session and then
deleted when Firefox is closed, and 3) 'persistent' - each session is appended
to the log which remains indefinately (Note: although TMN logs are not large,
the user might want to occasionally clear them (via te 'Clear Log' button when using this mode).

<li><h3>Show/Clear Log </h3>

The 'Show Log' button allows the user to view a snapshot of TMN's log state (refreshing
the browser window will keep this view current); The 'Clear Log' button, will
(as expected) clear and re-initialize TMN's log.

<li><h3>Logging Options</h3>
TMN offers 3 modes for logging: 1) 'disabled' - no logs are written, 2)
  'normal' (no options checked) - logs are kept for each session and then
deleted when Firefox is closed, and 3) 'persistent' - each session is appended
to the log which remains indefinately (Note: although TMN logs are not large,
the user is responsible for occasionally clearing them in this mode).

<li><h3>Show Status/Queries</h3>
These checkboxes control TMN's status bar -- if 'Show Queries' is unchecked,
TMN queries are not displayed as they are sent; if 'Show Status' is unchecked, no messages are displayed in the status bar at all.
